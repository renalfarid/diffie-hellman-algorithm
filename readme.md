implement Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) algorithm
bob and alice want to send message each other, they agreed to use Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) algorithm.
so they will generate key, exchange key each other to make shared key that use to encrypt and decrypt the message.
the message that bob want to send is "Hello, secured world !"
